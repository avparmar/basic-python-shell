# basic-python-shell


Hi.

This is a project I've been considering doing for a while and have now finally done so. Takes a lot of inspiration from yosh by Supasate Choochaisri, but I plan to add a couple more features of my own.

I mostly made this as a test of the various python imported libraries and how simple it could be to make a shell in python
(the one in C was not nearly as fun)
